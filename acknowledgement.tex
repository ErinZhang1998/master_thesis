I first and foremost thank my advisors, Professor Oliver Kromer and Professor Yonatan Bisk, for their patient adivisng through this project. I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to explore the creative drawing domain with them during my masters. Through working with them, I learnt about how humans use language and challenges ahead in terms of creating systems that can interact seamlessly with humans.
