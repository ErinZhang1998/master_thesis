I first and foremost thank my advisors, Professor Oliver Kroemer and Professor Yonatan Bisk, for advising me on this project. I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to explore the creative sketching domain with them during my Master's. 
Through working with them on this project, I have learned how humans use language creatively to describe sketches, and I am excited about building systems that can interact seamlessly with humans in the future. I want to thank Professor Jean Oh for being on my committee. 

I also want to thank my lab mates in the IAM and COMEDY lab (the name \textit{COMEDY} was coined in April 2022 \faIcon{laugh-wink}). Thank you guys for testing the numerous beta versions of my data collection interface and providing feedback without which the official deployment would not have been as successful. 

I thank my parents for encouraging me to pursue research topics that I enjoy. Thank you guys for listening to me all the time.
% to all my crazy ideas.
