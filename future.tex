% The first question that we want to solve is what data should we collect in order to build a robot that can draw with humans? Inspired by drawing sessions created by Bob Ross, we have considered painting with robots and experimented briefly with oil painting on canvas with a Franka robot, but precise execution of brush strokes and the technical details surrounding manipulating brushes to create the desire scene are even very difficult for humans, and the focus of our research is to make a step towards human-robot collaboration on tasks, we do not want to be side-tracked by difficulties around robot control, which in itself is an extremely interesting problem that we wish to explore another time.
