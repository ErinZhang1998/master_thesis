\subsubsection{Qualification}
We prepared 10 qualification questions, all in the style of yes/no questions. We will use the qualification test to filter annotators who have read through all the instructions and examples and have formed a good understanding of the task. The 10 questions are shown in Figure \ref{v2.qualification.1}. We provides hints in each questions that explicitly state which requirement and examples are helpful for solving the questions. The purpose of the qualification test is not to trick annotators but to ensure both quality and speed of the annotations.

We released $n$ copies of qualifications, and $n_2$ annotators scored $90$ or higher. The average score for the entire test is $x$, and the rate of correct answer for each question is shown in Table \ref{v2.qualification.success_rate}. Before releasing the qualification, we have tested the test on
