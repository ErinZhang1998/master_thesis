In this chapter, we evaluate CLIP and test its performance on recognizing concepts expressed in natural language in sketches. We will first introduce the classification task used for evaluation in Section \ref{modeling.task.def}. We will elaborate on CLIP, its contrastive objective, image and text encoder, in Section \ref{modeling.method}.
