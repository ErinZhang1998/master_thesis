\label{modeling.task.sketches}
\end{figure*}

% Since task should be method-independent, maybe mention that in this case we choose CLIP to do this task. This task can be done wtih any multimodal embeddings. 
Given two sketches $(s_1,s_2)$ and their part annotations $(t_1,t_2)$, such as the pair shown in Figure \ref{modeling.task.sketches}, the task is to determine which sketch $t_j$ should be paired with.
We use this task to evaluate the joint vision-language embedding space of CLIP, which is often used as part of the objective function for models that generate image from text; the objective function often involves maximizing the cosine similarity between the generated image and the provided text (or some variants engineered to work for the particular latent space of the generator used) \citep{clipDrawPaper,styleCLIPPaper,styleganNadaPaper,dalle2Paper}. 
Through this task, we can study how well CLIP can recognize different visual concepts in sketches, and the experiments can help us determine if CLIP can be used in similar ways to guide part-based sketch generation from language. Moreover, since we give CLIP the same pairs that were given to the annotators, we can learn if CLIP can understand how people are using language to describe the visual features of the sketches.   

% How to use CLIP to do this task?
Given $(s_1,s_2)$, we use CLIP image encoder (zero-shot/fine-tuned) $f_v$ to extract visual features for the two sketches,  $f_v(s_1) \in {R}^{512}$, and $f_v(s_2) \in {R}^{512}$. We then use the zero-shot/fine-tuned CLIP text encoder to extract the text features for the part descriptions, namely we fill in the template $t = \texttt{[ADJ] [PART NAME]}$, where $\texttt{[ADJ]}$ is filled with the adjective phrases annotations, and $\texttt{[PART NAME]}$ is the name of the part in the sketches. For angels, $\texttt{[PART NAME]}$ is one of \textit{halo}, \textit{eyes}, \textit{nose}, \textit{mouth}, \textit{body}, \textit{outline of face}, \textit{wings}; for face, $\texttt{[PART NAME]}$ is one of \textit{eyes}, \textit{nose}, \textit{mouth}, \textit{hair}, \textit{outline of face}. After filling in the above template, we obtain the part annotations for the two sketches $t_1,t_2$.  
We obtain embeddings for the part annotations by encoding them through CLIP text encoder $f_t$: $f_t(t_1) \in {R}^{512}$, and $f_t(t_2) \in {R}^{512}$. We then calculate cosine similarity between all four pairs of $(f_v(s_i), f_t(t_j))$, $i,j \in [2]$, where consine similarity between two vectors $u,v$ is defined as $S_c(u,v) = \dfrac{u \cdot v}{\|u\| \|v\|}$. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        I_1, I_2 \\
        T_1, T_2 \\
        S_c(I_i,T_j) & = \dfrac{I_i \cdot T_j}{\|I_i\| \|T_j\|} \\
        S_c(u,v) & = \dfrac{u \cdot v}{\|u\| \|v\|} \\
        f(j) & = \max_{i} S_c(f_v(s_i), f_t(t_j)) \hspace{2em} i \in [2]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Therefore, given that our entire pipeline is $f$, $f(j) \in [2]$ output which of the two sketches $t_j$ will be paired with, and $$f(j) = \max_{i} S_c(f_v(s_i), f_t(t_j)) \hspace{2em} i \in [2]$$.    



\section{Method}
% Which package did we use? Why transformers?
CLIP stands for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, and it seeks to learn image representations that transfer to a wide range of downstream tasks such as image classification on datasets with a wide variety of source domains. To do so, it uses the task of pairing images with their corresponding captions for pre-training.   
% the Vision Transformer \citep{visiontransformer} as the image encoder; \texttt{B} stands for \textit{Base} model, and \texttt{32} stands for $32 \times 32$ input patch size. 
CLIP has two main parts: a text encoder and an image encoder, and both can be transformers. 
To model our dataset, we fine-tune the pre-trained \texttt{ViT-B/32} CLIP model by leveraging the \texttt{Python} \texttt{clip} package. 
In this section, we will first introduce the details of the CLIP contrastive objective. We will then introduce the transformer-based text and iamge encoders. 



\subsection{Pre-training and Fine-tuning with Contrastive Objective} \label{clip.objective}

\begin{figure*}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{modeling/CLIP.png}  
\caption{CLIP uses contrastive pre-training instead of generative objective to learn joint vision-language embeddings. This image is taken from Figure 1 in the original CLIP paper \citep{CLIPpaper}.}
\label{modeling.clip.pretrainingobj}
\end{figure*}

Pre-training on an enormous amount of image-caption data with a contrastive objective, CLIP is able to learn a robust vision-language joint embedding that allows it to perform on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models learnt with supervised objectives.   


% It is difficult to predict the exact captions for an image, since there is usually a wide variety of text descriptions co-occuring with images, so instead CLIP turns to contrastive objectives and solves the problem of determining which text and image should be matched together. 
As shown in Figure \ref{modeling.clip.pretrainingobj}, during pre-training, for a batch of $N$ (text,image) pairs, CLIP obtains $N$ image features and $N$ text features from the encoders. It then calculates the cosine similarities between each of the $N \times N$ pairings of the image and text features. The values are used as logit scores for calculating symmetric cross-entropy loss used to train the network.      


CLIP is trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected form a variety of publicly available sources on the Internet.

The query list that is used to compile these (image,text) pairs is the union of (1) words that occur $\geq 100$ times in English Wikipedia; (2) names of Wikipedia articles whose search volume is above certain threshold; (2) high pointwise mutual information (PMI) bi-grams, and (4) $117,000$ WordNet synsets, or sets of cognitive synonyms. 

During training, for a given batch size $N$, we have $N$ sketch-text pairs, $(s_k,t_k), k\in [N]$. 
As explained in \cite{CLIPpaper}, we can treat each batch as containing $N$ visual concepts expressed through language.    
To pre-train/fine-tune CLIP, we perform \textit{classification} over these $N$ visual concepts, using cross-entropy loss on the dot-product of the (image,text) embeddings. 
Let $I_f \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 512}$ be image embedding for the $N$ images in the batch outputted by the image encoder; similarly, 
let $T_f \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 512}$ be text embedding for the $N$ captions in the batch outputted by the text encoder. 
We then use dot-product to generate.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \text{image encoder: } E_i \\
    \text{text encoder: } E_t \\
    I_1^{'},\dots, I_N^{'} \\
    T_1^{'},\dots, T_N^{'} \\
    I_1,\dots, I_N \\
    T_1,\dots, T_N \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}


By calculating pairwise dot-product $I_i \cdot T_j$, we obtain a logit matrix $X$ of dimension $N\times N$, where $X_{ij} = I_i \cdot T_j$. Through softmax, if we normalize each row, then we obtain a distribution over the texts of how likely the $i$-th image is paired with the $j$-th caption; similarly, normalizing each column via softmax, we obtain a distribution over the images of how likely the $j$-th caption is paired with the $i$-th image.   
% image logits $X_v$ over the text descriptions and text logits $X_t$ over the images. 
The ground-truth $Y$ is pairing the $i$-th image with the $i$-th caption.  
$Y = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & \cdots & N \end{bmatrix}^T $ 
To calculate the loss $L_I(X, Y)$ of selecting the correct caption for each image:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    L_I(X, Y) = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N -\log\frac{\exp\{ {X}_{i,i} \}}{ \sum_{j=1}^N \exp\{ {X}_{i,j} \} }
\end{split}
\end{equation}

To calculate the loss $L_T(X, Y)$ of selecting the correct image for each caption:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    L_T(X, Y) = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N -\log\frac{\exp\{ {X}_{j,j} \}}{ \sum_{i=1}^N \exp\{ {X}_{i,j} \} }
\end{split}
\end{equation}


The final loss is defined as:
$$L = \dfrac{1}{2} (L_I(X, Y) + L_T(X, Y))$$


\subsection{Text Encoder}

% \paragraph{Transformer: Attention is All You Need}
\begin{figure*}[!htb]
\begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{modeling/transformer.png}  
    \caption{Encoder architecture used in original Transformer paper \citep{attentionAllYouNeed}.}

\hspace{5mm}
\begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}

    \label{modeling.attention.clipEncoder}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Text encoder architecture.}
\label{modeling.transformer}
\end{figure*}

The text encoder of CLIP is based on the transformer architecture introduced in \citet{attentionAllYouNeed}. Transformer relies only on self-attention mechanism to compute a representation for the input sequence. In this way, it alleviates the computation efficiency and long-range dependencies problems witnessed in recurrent layers.  
Figure \ref{modeling.transformer.origEncoder} and \ref{modeling.attention} are the same figures used in \cite{attentionAllYouNeed} to illustrate the transformer architecture. In Figure \ref{modeling.transformer.origEncoder}, \cite{attentionAllYouNeed} gives an overview of the encoder architecture; tokenized texts go through an embedding layer, and the input embeddings are summed with learned position embeddings that inject information on order of the sequence. 
% and incorporated modification suggested in \citet{Radford2019LanguageMA}
The input is computed using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with a $49,152$ vocabulary. As explained in \cite{Radford2019LanguageMA}, BPE, a sub-word tokenization scheme, strikes a good balance between word-level and character-level word embeddings, since one works well with common words and the other with rare sequences.
The input is then passed through stacked layers multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism followed by point-wise feed-forward networks (FFN). 
In the version of CLIP that we use, the text encoder is a 12-layer transformer, and the model dimenison is $512$, $d_{model} = 512$, meaning that output of the initial embedding layers, MHA, FFN all have dimension $512$.  
Compare to the formulation $LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))$ used in \cite{attentionAllYouNeed} (Figure \ref{modeling.transformer.origEncoder}), the CLIP text encoder uses $x + Sublayer(LayerNorm(x))$ (Figure \ref{modeling.attention.clipEncoder}), where $Sublayer$ refers to either MHA or FFN, so each layer still contains residual connection and layer normalization, but the order is switched. 


\begin{figure*}[!htb]
\begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\linewidth]{modeling/selfAttention.png}  
    \caption{.}

\begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}

    \label{modeling.attention.multihead}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Screenshots of counterexamples used in first version of the requirements in Version 1.}
\label{modeling.attention}
\end{figure*}

As illustrated in Figure \ref{modeling.attention.multihead}, given query, key, value matricies $Q,K,V$ (in our case, all three matrices equal to the input text embeddings), transformer uses different linear projections to create multi-head attention, and \citet{attentionAllYouNeed} explains the benefit of multi-head attention as allowing the model to attend simultaneously to multiple representation subspaces of the input.      

\begin{equation} \label{mha}
\begin{split}
    MultiHead(Q,K,V) & = Concat({head}_1,\dots,{head}_h)W^O \\
    {head}_i & = Attention(QW_i^{Q}, KW_i^{K}, VW_i^{V}) \\
    Attention(Q,K,V) & = softmax(\dfrac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$\text{ViT-B}/32$ uses a version with $h = 8$ attention heads, so $W_i^{Q}, W_i^{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_k}$ and $W_i^{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_v}$, where $d_k = d_v = \dfrac{d_{model}}{h} = \frac{512}{8} = 64$. 
At the end of the multi-head attention mechanism, the weighted combination of values from each head is concatenated together and passed through a linear layer, represented here as $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{(d_v \times h) \times d_v}$. 
CLIP uses the ``Scaled Dot-Product Attention'' in \cite{attentionAllYouNeed}, illustrated in details in Figure \ref{modeling.attention.dot}. The dot products between query and key determine the weights that are used to sum the values; in this way, we have a contextualized representation; compared to convolutions that use static kernels, attention weights are dynamic.   

\subsection{Vision Transformer}
\begin{figure*}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{modeling/visionTransformer.png}  
\caption{Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture \citep{ViT}.}
\label{modeling.visionTransformer}
\end{figure*}

The image encoder of CLIP uses Vision Transformer (ViT) introduced in \cite{ViT}. The architecture of ViT is very similar to the original transformer introduced in \cite{attentionAllYouNeed}. 
In order to reuse the transformer model, ViT needs to first turn an image of size $H\times W \times C$, ($H$, $W$, $C$ stands for image height, width, channel size, respectively), into a sequence of ``tokens'', similar to the text input.  
To do so, \cite{ViT} reshapes the image to size $N \times (P^2 \cdot C)$, where $N$ is the number of patches and $P$ the patch size; the reshaped image can be seen as a sequence of $N$ image tokens, each having a dimension of $P^2 \cdot C$. Each image token is then passed through a linear layer to be mapped to dimension $D$, similar to the model dimension $d_{model}$ earlier. 
In the version of CLIP that we used, $H = W = 224$, $C = 3$, $P = 32$, and $D = 768$. 
As explained in \cite{ViT}, before passing into the transformer, we also need to prepend a \texttt{[class]} token at the front the sequence, whose embedding at the last layer of the transformer will be used as the representation for the entire image. In this way, each image is represented as a sequence of $7\times 7 + 1 = 50$ tokens, illustrated as purple boxes in Figure \ref{modeling.visionTransformer}. The pink boxes that are right next to the patch embeddings represent position embeddings, with a similar function to encoder sequence order information as in the text transformer. 
For the CLIP image encoder, layer normalization is applied to the input before passing into the transformer and to the output at the last layer.


\subsection{Image Pre-Processing}
We use the data provided by SPG \citep{spg_paper}, which provides JSON files of the Quick,Draw! sketches in vector format: each sketch is composed of a sequence of $n$ strokes $S_i, i \in [n]$, and $S_i$ is a sequence of vectors $(\delta x,\delta y, p, l)$. $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ are changes in the $x,y$ coordinates with respect to the previous point; for the first point, it is with respect to $(25,25)$. All points are assumed to be drawn on a $256 \times 256$ canvas. $p=1$ if the point is the last point in the current stroke, and $p=0$ otherwise. The SPG dataset provides annotation for semantic segmentation of the sketches, so $l$ is a number representing the semantically meaningful object part.  

% We obtained the rendered sketches by using \texttt{Pycairo}, which is a Python module providing bindings for the cairo graphics library. We use a line width of $5$. After rendering, we manually examined the sketches and filter out face sketches that do not have a pair of eyes, a mouth and the face outline; we also filter out angel sketches that are incomplete or have all the parts merged together, possibly due to collection errors in SPG.   

\subsection{Text Pre-Processing}
We used the \texttt{spacy} package to preprocess the text. \texttt{spacy} provides trained natural language processing pipeline and includes models for, for example, token-to-vector and part-of-speech tagging. We use the \texttt{en\_core\_web\_sm} pipeline and its lemmatizer to reduce words to their basic forms. Moreover, we lower-case all words and remove punctuation, a list of which is provided by \texttt{Python} \texttt{string} package, \texttt{string.punctuation}. We also remove words like \textit{shaped}, \textit{sized}, \textit{and}, \textit{like}, since they act like stop words and do not provide additional visual descriptions of the sketches. Text descriptions are also tokenized by CLIP's tokenizer before passing into CLIP text encoder.     


% Metric used
Given $n$ pairs of two sketches and two part annotations, the same pairs that were provided by the annotators, we calculate an accuracy-like metric:
$$ acc = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^2 \mathbbm{1}{(f(j) = j)}}{2n} $$

% As mentioned above, our dataset has a small number of sketches: 572 face sketches and 787 angel sketches.
