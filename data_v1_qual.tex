We set up a qualification test on AMT to (1) train turkers to have better understanding of the task and (2) to select turkers who can provide annotations that satisfy all the requirements. Similar to the process of writing the requirements, we went through several rounds of testing with students in the lab to come up with a set of questions that have good correspondence with the requirements. The qualification test starts with the same instruction and requirements that will be used in the final HIT, thus allowing turkers to familiarize themselves with the requirements; moreover, this give them a chance to ask for clarifications before the final HIT. The test leads with a navigation bar (Figure \ref{v1.qualification.nav}) to make it convenient for turkers to switch between questions; originally, we displayed all questions in one page, but some people found it time-consuming to scroll from the later questions back up to the instructions, so we decided to display one question at a time. 
% We have refined the format of the qualification as we gathered feedback from people in the lab; we show a subset of the intermediate versions in Figure.
We show one question from the final qualification in Figure \ref{v1.qualification.q9}. We replicate the exact main task interface in the qualification test, and turkers need to determine whether every step of the mock annotation satisfies all the requirements; we also include hints on which requirement the question is testing for to encourage turkers to revisit the requirements and form better understanding of the task.

% [Figure x5: final qualification test]
%  At first, we asked the annotators to select which steps of the annotations satisfy the requirements (Figure x6.a); in order to use repetition to ensure deep understanding of the requirements, we changed to asking a yes/no question for every step, as shown in Figure x6.b.
