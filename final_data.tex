\section{Dataset Summary} \label{datasummary}
Our dataset contains sketches, their semantic part annotations, and descriptions for every part in a sketch. 
The sketches comes from the QuickDraw dataset \citep{ha2017neural}, and the semantic part annotations come from the SPG dataset \citep{spg_paper}; both datasets are explained in details in Section \ref{relatedWorkChapter}.

We annotated for 2 categories of sketches: face and angel. 
For angel sketches, we annotate for the parts \textit{halo}, \textit{eyes}, \textit{nose}, \textit{mouth}, \textit{body}, \textit{outline of face}, and \textit{wings}. 
For face sketches, we annotate for the parts \textit{eyes}, \textit{nose}, \textit{mouth}, \textit{hair}, \textit{outline of face}.

In Table \ref{table:dataset_stats_byparts}, we present dataset statistics broken down by semantic parts, and, in Table \ref{table:dataset_stats1}, we show the same statistics by sketch category. In Figure \ref{word_freq}, we show 100 most frequently used words in our dataset. 

% \subsection{Compare with DoodlerGAN Dataset}
The \textit{Creative Birds} and \textit{Creative Creatures} datasets collected by DoodlerGAN \citep{doodlerGAN} contain 2 categories, like ours, but there are 9k sketches in each category, and ours contains one tenth as many. Although we fall short on the number of sketches and the variety of sketching styles, we approach creativity from a completely different angle: we focus on how people compose similar basic shapes to create sketches of different categories and adapt similar language to describe different sketch parts, as explained in Section \ref{introductionChapter} and Figure \ref{introduction.composition}.  

Our face sketches contain 5 different parts, and angel sketches has 7 parts; there are 7 parts in Creative Birds and 16 parts in Creative Creatures. Again, we do not annotate for as many parts as DoodlerGAN if compare directly with them. However, in our dataset, every part in every sketch has at least 2 different language annotations describing the visual features, while DoodlerGAN has no language annotation. With text descriptions, in addition to part-based generative model, we can study how people compose concepts (e.g. \textit{large}$+$\textit{round}) and apply the same concepts to different semantic parts (e.g. \textit{round eyes} and \textit{round halo}).     

% In general, we observe that compared to previous work that tend to have a fixed list of adjectives for each object parts, the descriptions in our dataset are free-form and non-constrainted. This characteristics is desirable and aligns with our goal to allow robot to collaborate smoothly with humans, since different people would describe the same things in very diverse ways.
